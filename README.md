# JavaScript Projects

Here are few of mine JavaScript Projects.
Some of them uses procedurial syntax while few of them are object oriented

The following are the projects purely written in JavaScript

1)arithmetic.js: this project calculates the arithmetic sequence, classifies the array or sequence whether it is an Arithmetic Progression, creating an arithmetic     sequence based on given input, getting the term and getting the sum and difference of a sequence.

2)geometry.js: to execute geometrical calculations with a few number of weights and inputs

3)intrest.js: calculates the simple and compound intrest and also drafts a report of annual intrest.

4)quadraticEq.js: this project calculates and frames a quadratic equation based on the given coefficient.

5)subset.js: to check whether an array is subset of another array. it returns result in a boolean value


The core purpose of this projects is to absorb and understand the datatypes, functions, classes, loops, scoping in JavaScript and trying an convinient, scalable and a flexible approach each of the project have their custom algorithms to perform their respective tasks.
